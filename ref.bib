  abstract = {Abstract. Kayne (1994) was instrumental in putting linear asymmetries on the generative research agenda. His Linear Correspondence Axiom is seen as a restrictive, conceptually attractive proposal supported by a wealth of empirical evidence. In this paper, we take issue with this assessment. (i) We show that for every structure that violates the LCA, there is an LCA-compatible counterpart, including rightward movement structures and structures with rightward specifiers. (ii) We discuss Cinque's (2005) LCA-based analysis of word order in the extended nominal projection, demonstrating that the data in fact do not support any hypothesis stronger than a ban on rightward movement. (iii) We demonstrate that claims to the effect that central properties of phrase structure (such as headedness and the single-specifier restriction) follow from the LCA are incorrect. (iv) We show that the LCA is toothless without a restrictive theory of movement, but that it can only be reconciled with the data in the absence of such a theory.},

Some simple constraints on obviation provide interesting analyses of key facts in Algonquian. Once certain language-particular differences are recognized, a number of syntactic problems in two unrelated languages, Tzotzil (Mayan) and Chamorro (Western Austronesian), yield easily to solutions based on obviation, despite the absence of obviative-based morphology in either language. Hierarchy alignment constraints play a central role in the analysis. The account is articulated within optimality theory, which provides an appropriate framework for representing the fact that these languages must select from their resources for expressing transitive propositions the optimal mode of expression for each such proposition.},

This is particularly pressing in the light of persistent rumors, encouraged by a number of authors , that his program has proven bankrupt, "completely wrong" and has been replaced by various sorts of proposals in general statistical learning and "functionalist/constructionist" linguistic theories (which we return to below). We think these rumors are seriously mistaken. To be sure, the theory has evolved, displaying the kinds of complexities, revisions and increasing depth typical of any ongoing science. However, Chomsky's ideas and those of others working in his "generativist" framework are at the center of much of the most successful current work on the grammar of human language, and his work has been influential across many other areas of linguistics, including research on processing, language acquisition, language diversity and semantics. His program is one of the most important in the history of linguistics, and it has profound and enduring significance for psychology and philosophy, and indeed for our understanding of human nature generally"--},

Proponents of neutral aspect assume that (im)perfectivity is defined in terms of reference to an event’s completion. This paper refines this idea, distinguishing between an event that culminated and one that ceased to develop further. The latter notion comes from Landman’s (1992) analysis of the progressive, which denotes a function from a set of events in the extension of the VP that it combines with to a set of event stages that develop into VP-events according to a particular recipe. Building on Landman’s analysis, I propose that a perfective operator is one that requires a maximal stage of a VP-event; an imperfective operator is one that requires a VP-event stage, but this stage need not be maximal. I show how this analysis allows us to analyze the Hindi –yaa and the Russian –yva as being perfective and imperfective respectively, without any reference to neutrality.},

  abstract = {The nineteenth-century conception that linguistic structure was to be explained by recourse to the histories of languages was largely abandoned with the rise of synchronic theories in the twentieth century, but has recently returned to prominence. Whereas traditional generative theories of language have tended to attribute crosslinguistic regularities to constraints imposed on the class of possible grammars by the human Language Faculty, some scholars have argued that this is often a mistake: that there are no (or at least very few) real substantive universals of language, and that the regularities in question arise from common paths of diachronic change having their basis in factors outside of the defining properties of the set of cognitively accessible grammars. This review surveys evidence for that position, primarily in phonology but also in morphology and syntax. I argue that in phonology, there are at present no convincingly demonstrated substantive universals governing the set of possible regularities, and that the generalizations we find should be attributed to a combination of contingent historical developments and biases in the learning algorithm that relates available data to the grammars learners acquire. In morphology and syntax, I argue that some apparent generalizations are indeed the product of diachronic change rather than synchronic constraint.},

It will be shown that there are verbs in several Germanic languages which exhibit genuine ABA patterns,~precluding an analysis based on a constraint *ABA. It is suggested that the rarity of ABA patterns~should instead be given a diachronic explanation in terms of Proto-Germanic conjugation~classes. This approach is independently motivated by frequency asymmetries in modern Germanic~languages, and correctly predicts where ABA patterns are more likely to appear. The research reported here adds to a rapidly-growing body of work on extralinguistic explanations for linguistic patterns (Anderson 2016), suggesting a severely reduced explanatory role for formal linguistic constraints.},

In the domain of logical connectives, AND and OR are often lexicalized, lexicalizations of NOR are less common and tend to be structurally complex, and no other logical connective is ever lexicalized. Existing accounts fail to fully derive this major crosslinguistic pattern, and moreover resort to otherwise unwarranted assumptions. The goal of this paper is to provide an account which is less stipulative and has wider empirical coverage than previous accounts, based on a novel notion of communicative stability. Using a model of a rational speaker we observe that attested languages are stable languages, i.e., languages in which the optimal message for a speaker to choose when they want to convey a particular state they are in is not affected by which states they take to be more likely and which ones less. We argue that Stability can account both for why AND and OR are the only simple connectives lexicalized and for why NOR is the only complex connective lexicalized.},

  abstract = {Why are AND and OR the only binary connectives that are lexicalized as simplex? Horn ( ) first observed this striking typological fact and suggested an account that relied on the assumption that ‘positive’ connectives like AND and OR are inherently simpler than other connectives. Much subsequent work adopted this assumption, along with Horn’s insight that the strengthening of utterances through scalar implicature plays a role in explaining the typological pattern. Bar-Lev \& Katzir ( a) aim to derive the typological pattern from strengthening alone, without assuming that ‘positive’ connectives are inherently simpler. The present remark aims to address several issues for their view, building in part on work by Enguehard ( ) and Bar-Lev \& Katzir ( b), by taking a step back and asking why connectives are lexicalized to begin with. We suggest that the motivation for lexicalizing connectives comes from their ability to help in answering questions. In particular, connectives should help speakers convey their epistemic state with respect to a given question. We show that, once several proposals from the recent literature on questions and strengthening are adopted, AND and OR turn out to be the only connectives whose lexicalization allows speakers to convey their epistemic attitude towards all the possible complete answers to a given question. This provides a simpler and more principled derivation of what sets apart AND and OR from the other connectives than earlier accounts of Horn ( )’s typological puzzle.},

An axiom ensures that any event in Neg(P) is actual if and only if no event in P is. This allows us to construe the events in Neg(P) as negative, “anti-P”, events. We present a syntax-semantics interface that uses continuations to resolve scope mismatches between subject and verb phrase negation, and a fragment of English that accounts for the interaction of negation, the perception verb see, finite and nonfinite perception reports, and quantified subjects, as well as negative causation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Long‐distance agreement (LDA) refers to agreement between a functional head in the extended projection of one lexical head with an argument of another lexical head. LDA is found in a variety of languages, including Indo‐Aryan (Hindi/Urdu, Kashmiri, Kutchi), Basque, Tsez, Chukotko‐Kamchatkan, and native North American languages (Innu‐aimûn, Passamaquoddy). All instances of LDA described in the literature share a number of properties. First, LDA uses the same primitives as local agreement. Every element that may control LDA may also trigger local agreement. The morphological forms of LDA are also found in local agreement. Second, LDA is generally optional. This is all the more relevant because local agreement is always obligatory in these languages. Third, a verb can agree with an element in a lower clause, but not with one in a higher clause.             Virtually all studies on LDA converge in that they treat it as local in some sense. The following general lines of analysis have been proposed. First, the LDA controller is (possibly covertly) moved into the matrix clause and triggers agreement from there. Second, the LDA trigger moves to the edge of the embedded clause and agrees from there. Third, LDA depends on whether or not a locality boundary (i.e., phase head) is projected in the embedded clause (restructuring). Fourth, the LDA controller triggers local agreement with a functional head in the embedded clause. A matrix head subsequently agrees with the embedded functional head. Fifth, a silent pronoun coreferent with the embedded object is inserted into the matrix clause and triggers local agreement there. These lines of analysis are not mutually exclusive.             LDA has been argued to provide evidence against Upward Agree. It furthermore is crucial for the general question of syntactic locality. It also raises the general problem of optionality in syntax, in particular since the optionality of agreement appears to correlate with distance.},

An analysis of the semantics of perfect aspect in terms of placing the topic time in the post-time of the event under description can account for the anterior tense readings of the pluperfect as well. In this article, I argue that “Klein’s Conjecture” appears more problematic once extended to other languages, drawing on evidence from Japanese, Kituba, Kalaallisut, Korean, and Yucatec Maya. Languages such as Japanese have expressions of anterior tense that do not fit Klein’s analysis of perfect aspect (topic time after event time), while others—e.g., Yucatec Maya—have expressions that fit Klein’s analysis, but do not have anterior tense readings. The additions to Klein’s theory necessary so it can accommodate the new evidence comprise a revised viewpoint aspect component that distinguishes not only relations between topic and event time, but also relations between topic time and the runtimes of states preceding and following the event in a causal chain, as well as an updated tense module that distinguishes relations between topic time and perspective times in addition to relations between topic time and utterance time.},

  abstract = {Davidsonian event semantics is often taken to form an unhappy marriage with compositional semantics. For example, it has been claimed to be problematic for semantic accounts of quantification (Beaver and Condoravdi, in: Aloni et al. (eds.) Proceedings of the 16th Amsterdam Colloquium, 2007), for classical accounts of negation (Krifka, in: Bartsch et al. (eds.) Semantics and contextual expression, 1989), and for intersective accounts of verbal coordination (Lasersohn, in Plurality, conjunction and events, 1995). This paper shows that none of this is the case, once we abandon the idea that the event variable is bound at sentence level, and assume instead that verbs denote existential quantifiers over events. Quantificational arguments can then be given a semantic account, negation can be treated classically, and coordination can be modeled as intersection. The framework presented here is a natural choice for researchers and fieldworkers who wish to sketch a semantic analysis of a language without being forced to make commitments about the hierarchical order of arguments, the argument-adjunct distinction, the default scope of quantifiers, or the nature of negation and coordination.},

Chapter 1 introduces the notion of dynamic semantics and discusses in detail the phenomena that have been used to motivate it, such as "donkey" sentences and adverbs of quantification. The second chapter explores in greater depth the interpretation of indefinites and issues related to presuppositions of uniqueness and the "E-type strategy." In Chapter 3, Chierchia extends the dynamic approach to the domain of syntactic theory, considering a range of empirical problems that includes backwards anaphora, reconstruction effects, and weak crossover. The final chapter develops the formal system of dynamic semantics to deal with central issues of definites and presupposition. Chierchia shows that an approach based on a principled enrichment of the mechanisms dealing with meaning is to be preferred on empirical grounds over approaches that depend on an enrichment of the syntactic apparatus.Dynamics of Meaning illustrates how seemingly abstract stances on the nature of meaning can have significant and far-reaching linguistic consequences, leading to the detection of new facts and influencing our understanding of the syntax/semantics/pragmatics interface.},

Definiteness is seen as a morphological category which, in English, marks a (weak) uniqueness presupposition, while determinacy consists in denoting an individual. Definite descriptions are argued to be fundamentally predicative, presupposing uniqueness but not existence, and to acquire existential import through general type-shifting operations that apply not only to definites, but also indefinites and possessives. Through these shifts, argumental definite descriptions may become either determinate (and thus denote an individual) or indeterminate (functioning as an existential quantifier). The latter option is observed in examples like ‘Anna didn’t give the only invited talk at the conference’, which, on its indeterminate reading, implies that there is nothing in the extension of ‘only invited talk at the conference’. The paper also offers a resolution of the issue of whether possessives are inherently indefinite or definite, suggesting that, like indefinites, they do not mark definiteness lexically, but like definites, they typically yield determinate readings due to a general preference for the shifting operation that produces them.},

Differences between bare singulars and plurals in languages without determiners are explained by treating bare nominals as kind terms. Differences arise, it is argued, because singular and plural kinds relate differently to their instantiations. In languages with determiners, singular kinds typically occur with the definite determiner, but plural/mass kinds can be bare in some languages and definite in others. An account of singular kinds in terms of taxonomic readings is proposed, with number marking playing a crucial role in explaining the obligatory presence of the determiner. The variation between languages with respect to plural/mass kinds is explained by positing a universal scale of definiteness, with individual languages choosing different cut-off points for lexicalization of the definite determiner. The possibility of further cross-linguistic variation is also considered.},

While the general pattern is cross‐linguistically very common, there is much variation in its precise syntax and semantics. In this chapter, I review the classic analyses of external possession as possessor raising and possessor binding. The evidence behind these analyses indicates that raising and binding are indeed each appropriate for certain subtypes of external possession, as is an analysis in terms of movement to thematic positions. I propose a typology that groups these analyses under the first of two major types of external possession. This first type presents significant parallels to the domain of raising and control, subsuming possessor raising, possessor binding, possessor control, and a variant of exceptional case marking (ECM). Examples are found in Nez Perce, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and English. A second major type of external possession involves subjects only and brings information structural effects. Examples are found in Malagasy, Chickasaw, Tz'utujil, and Japanese.},

  abstract = {What are the basic syntactic pieces underlying person systems, and how does the grammar combine and manipulate these pieces? Most discussion of these questions has taken place against a relatively standard backdrop of assumptions concerning the possible meanings of the semantic primitives to which syntactic pieces or features correspond. First person, for instance, refers to the individual who is speaking; second person refers to the individual who is being addressed. This paper explores what can be learned about the syntactic and semantic representation of person from cases where this baseline behavior fails to hold. Three case studies are presented. The first investigates the relationship between second person features and first person features, focusing in particular on cases where first person shifts but second person does not. I show that (perhaps surprisingly) these facts are compatible both with a theory with dedicated second person features and with a theory positing only speaker and participant features. The second case study explores the nature of locative expressions, and in particular the proposal from Harbour 2016 that words such as "here" have person features at their core. I argue against this proposal based on cases where first person shifts but locatives do not. Lastly, the third case study investigates the nature of person inflection in languages such as Amharic, which contain indexiphors (Deal 2018). I argue that "first person inflection" in this language reflects a syncretism between two separate types of features, properly indexical first person features (which reference the author of the context) and indexiphoric author features (which reference the author of the index of interpretation). (Along the way, I present an analysis of what has been sometimes called ``shifty agreement.'') Syncretism of this type suggests that standard first person features are not themselves primitive, but rather consist at the "subatomic'' level of a specification of the author function and a specification of the formal object (the context) to which this function applies.},

Dayal (2004) demonstrates that the interpretation of bare nouns with respect to definiteness is significantly constrained in Hindi and Russian. In these languages, singular and plural bare nouns present different possibilities for indefinite interpretation, in a way that receives a natural explanation within a neo-Carlsonian theory of noun meaning (Chierchia, 1998). This makes for a close connection between the meanings of bare nouns in English and those in Hindi and Russian. Does this connection extend to the meanings of bare nouns in numbermarking languages in general, even outside of Indo-European? In this paper, we demonstrate that the answer is yes. Our evidence comes from bare noun interpretation in Teotitla´n del Valle Zapotec, a language of Oaxaca, Mexico. The Zapotec findings closely replicate Dayal’s findings for Indo-European languages, providing support for the viability of the neo-Carlsonian approach as a set of constraints on semantic variation in general.},

Furthermore, I show that if we modify the compositional interpretation rules in certain simple ways, this dual content account of noun phrase modification can be implemented in a type-driven formal semantic framework. In addition, I also argue against traditional accounts of privative noun phrases which can be paired with the assumption that nouns do not have a dual semantic structure.

The heart of our account is that stages of acquisition follow the geometry of the syntactic tree, along the lines of the cartographic analysis of the clause, with early stages of acquisition corresponding to small portions of the adult syntactic tree, which keeps growing with the growth of the child. The lower parts of the tree are acquired first, and higher parts are acquired later. We propose three stages of acquisition connected to the development of functional layers of the syntactic tree. In the first stage, the IP is acquired, including the lexical and inflectional layers. This allows for the appearance of A-movement structures, including SV/VS alternations with unaccusative verbs, alongside SV sentences with unergative/transitive verbs. The second stage involves the acquisition of the lower part of the left periphery, up to QP, which allows for the acquisition of subject and object Wh questions, some adjunct questions, yes/no questions, and sentence-initial adverbs. In the third stage, the rich structure of the left periphery is completely acquired, including the higher CP field. This is the stage in which sentential embedding (of finite declarative and interrogative clauses), subject and object relative clauses, why questions, and topicalization appear. A further, different type of stage, which occurs on the already-grown tree and which is independent of structure building, is the acquisition of intervention configurations, allowing for the mastery of structures involving movement of a lexically-restricted object across an intervening lexicallyrestricted subject. The paper illustrates the fruitful dialogue between the science of syntax acquisition and the cartography of syntactic structures.},

  abstract = {Recent studies into the syntax and semantics of intensifying self-forms (e.g. [John HIMSELF] came) have shown that a distinction needs to be drawn between two uses of such expressions: a juxtaposed or adnominal use (cf. above), and a non-juxtaposed use (e.g. John [came HIMSELF]). This differentiation allows us to reconsider a number of issues relating to the synchronic and diachronic relationship between SELFintensifiers and reflexive anaphors. Assessing relevant cross-linguistic data against the background of the aforementioned distinction reveals a surprising fact: patterns of ‘formal relatedness’ suggest a particularly strong empirical as well as conceptual tie-up between reflexives and SELF-intensifiers in their non-juxtaposed rather than adnominal use. This is remarkable because it has generally been assumed that it is always the adnominal SELF-intensifier which gives rise to the development of reflexive markers. In the light of our cross-linguistic findings we explore the synchronic and diachronic relationship between reflexives and SELF-intensifiers in their non-juxtaposed use. We argue that the picture of a (unidirectional) development from adnominal SELF-intensifiers to reflexives needs to be modified insofar as reflexive markers often develop from non-juxtaposed, rather than adnominal, intensifiers. Moreover, reflexive markers often form part of a strategy of SELFintensification, which entails that the reflexives are older than the resulting intensifiers.},

  abstract = {Abstract               It has been assumed that in articleless languages such as Russian, bare singular NPs in argument positions can receive a definite or an indefinite interpretation. While the definite interpretation depends on the broader discourse and may freely arise if the referent is familiar, the option of an indefinite interpretation for bare NPs introducing new discourse referents is more restricted. This paper investigates conditions on the indefinite interpretation of bare singular NPs in Russian. It shows that this interpretation is restricted by the topic-comment structure: the indefinite interpretation may arise only if the NP belongs to the comment part of the sentence and is excluded for NPs which are aboutness topics. This restriction can be explained by the requirement that indefinite aboutness topics must be specific. Bare indefinite NPs however can only receive a non-specific existential interpretation, and hence do not qualify as topics. The paper contributes to the elucidation of the interaction between the semantic and pragmatic components of an overall theory of NP interpretation and argues that weak existential NPs should be distinguished from cases of noun incorporation.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with semantic developments in the Lithuanian and Latvian definite adjectival forms. The basic function of definite adjectival forms in Baltic is to mark the definiteness of the noun phrase. However, the adjectival marking of definiteness creates an interesting situation in which the noun phrase has several slots for the marking of (in)definiteness. In certain cases, different values for definiteness may appear in different slots: the adjective may be in the definite form whereas the noun phrase as a whole may be viewed as indefinite and can occur with formal markers of indefiniteness such as indefinite pronouns. These cases afford certain insights into the periphery of definiteness and the mechanisms of extension of definiteness markers into the domain of indefiniteness. The factors involved in this spill-over of definiteness markers are (i) genericity, realised in the form of so-called definite generics, whose definite markers are often retained when descending from the level of kind-reference to that of individual reference (this is referred to here as rigid or fossilised generic definiteness), and (ii) nominalisation of the adjective, which enables the retention of definite marking when a noun phrase shifts from definite plural description to singular or plural indefinite description. An important factor in the spread of definite adjectives beyond the domain of definiteness of the noun phrase seems to be their ability to evoke ad hoc taxonomies. The instances of extended definiteness marking discussed in this paper have parallels in article languages that have only one slot for (in)definiteness marking. The presence of two slots for definiteness marking in Baltic brings to light the layered nature of the definiteness of many noun phrases,which leads to what is here called ‘definiteness conflicts’ and indeterminacy between the semantic zones of definiteness and indefiniteness.},

Across diverse semantic domains, crosslinguistic analyses show that natural language vocabularies are jointly optimized for two competing pressures: cognitive simplicity and informative communication. This paper applies an efficiency analysis to modals (e.g. can, ought, might). We define and measure the simplicity and informativeness of a large number of logically possible modal systems, including a sample of twenty seven natural language inventories. We also consider a recently-introduced semantic universal for modal expressions in natural language, dubbed the Independence of Force and Flavor (IFF). Our analysis yields three main results: (i) every optimal modal system perfectly satisfies the IFF universal; (ii) as systems contain more IFF modals, they become more efficient; (iii) attested modal systems are more efficient than merely possible systems. These results indicate that general pressures for efficient communication can explain typological variation in the lexicalization of modality.},

The suggested main strategies of development are 1) verbalization or finitization of participle predicates and 2) insubordination, the replacement of a main predicate with a reanalysed construction, which in this case originally consists of a lexical item affixed to a nominalized verb. Verbalization of participles has produced majority of the evidential and modal suffixes in Tundra Nenets, 10 of altogether 16 finite suffixes of the paradigm. Insubordination is a mechanism behind the only first-hand evidential in the language, encod­ ing non-visual direct evidence. The semantic changes in the grammaticalization of modal and evidential suffixes in Tundra Nenets are analogous with many similar tendencies attested in many other languages. These are: 1) resultative → evidential perfect, 2) prospective aspect → necessity → future, 3) similarity → inferred information, the speaker’s knowledge of an event on the basis of visual evidence, 4) lexical item meaning ‘sound, voice’ → first-hand evidentiality. Both of these grammaticalization strategies probably represent an areal pattern, which is encountered also in other Uralic and Siberian languages.},

The need for a reference grammar of Latvian written in English is especially important right now due to the existence of a large Latvian diaspora community abroad, particularly in English-speaking countries where children and young people are educated in the language of their home countries rather than in Latvian. A Latvian grammar written in English will also be useful for those who are learning Latvian as a foreign language and wish to learn more about its grammatical system and unique features. Likewise, “Latvian grammar” will be a useful reference and source for examples for teachers of Latvian – both those who teach it to speakers as a school or university subject and those who teach it as a foreign language. There is also considerable demand among linguists abroad for a systematic and dependable description of Latvian written by native speakers of Latvian. Latvian is a rather unique combination of ancient as well as relatively new features, which are of interest to researchers abroad and are important for the typological, cognitive, pragmatic, functional, and contrastive analysis of language.},

  title = {Influence of Structural Context on Modal Interpretation},
  author = {Kasenov, Daniar},
  abstract = {This thesis presents an argument in favor of contextual allosemy (polysemy with structural conditions) based on the domain of modal expressions, which present the following puzzle. On one hand, modals are systematically ambiguous between, e.g., epistemic and non-epistemic readings, which motivates the view that there is a single lexical item for modals. On the other hand, however, even in ambiguous modals, the epistemic and non-epistemic readings are associated with different syntactic properties — something unexpected under a view where there is a single lexical item for modals. My solution is that, similarly to contextual allomorphy (syntactic objects having a constant semantic interpretation, or ‘meaning’, and a variable morphological interpretation, or ‘form’, depending on the structural context), ambiguous modals have a constant morphological interpretation and a variable semantic interpretation depending on the structural context. Although the idea of variable semantic interpretation is a minority position in the generative literature, the behavior of modals stops being a problem once the assumptions about grammatical architecture are changed to allow such configurations. In fact, the existence of a syntactic object with constant morphological interpretation and variable semantic interpretation is exactly what one expects to have with contextual allosemy. The behavior of modals can thus be construed as an indirect argument for contextual allosemy.},

According to this theory, phrase structure always completely determines linear order, so that if two phrases differ in linear order, they must also differ in hierarchical structure.It is standardly assumed that Universal Grammar (UG) allows a given hierarchical representation to be associated with more than one linear order. For example, English and Japanese phrases consisting of a verb and its complement are thought of as symmetrical to one another, differing only in linear order. The Antisymmetry of Syntax proposes a restrictive theory of word order and phrase structure that denies this assumption. According to this theory, phrase structure always completely determines linear order, so that if two phrases differ in linear order, they must also differ in hierarchical structure. More specifically, Richard Kayne shows that asymmetric c-command invariably maps into linear precedence. From this follows, with few further hypotheses, a highly specific theory of word order in UG: that complement positions must always follow their associated head, and that specifiers and adjoined elements must always precede the phrase that they are sister to. A further result is that standard X-bar theory is not a primitive component of UG. Rather, X-bar theory expresses a set of antisymmetric properties of phrase structure. This antisymmetry is inherited from the more basic antisymmetry of linear order. Linguistic Inquiry Monograph No. 25},

  abstract = {Starting from a morphosyntactic puzzle of the Ugric and Samoyedic languages of the Uralic family (possessive agreement suffixes functioning as accusative allomorphs on pronominal objects), this paper identifies a pronoun cycle which leads from reflexives via intensifiers and via referentially independent intensive pronouns to neutral pronouns. In Tundra Nenets, evidence of three rounds of reflexive renewal is also pointed out, with the three sets of pronouns frozen at different stages of the cycle. The analysis has implications for debated issues of language change. It is shown that elements participating in cyclic changes not only suffer feature loss but also incorporate features. Based on the recurring cycle in Tundra Nenets, it is argued that the cyclicity of linguistic changes implies a notion of unidirectionality that also leaves room for unpredictable outcomes.},

It first provides a general characterization of IS — following Chafe (1976) — within a communicative model of Common Ground (CG), which distinguishes between CG content and CG management. IS is concerned with those features of language that affect the local CG. Second, this paper defines and discusses the notions of Focus (as indicating alternatives) and its various uses, Givenness (as indicating that a denotation is already present in the CG), and Topic (as specifying what a statement is about). It also proposes a new notion, Delimitation, which comprises contrastive topics and frame setters, and indicates that the current conversational move does not entirely satisfy the local communicative needs. It also points out that rhetorical structuring partly belongs to IS.},

The focused sub-constituent remains in situ, but there is abundant morphosyntactic evidence that the focus feature is passed up to the head of the clause. The result is the formation of a complex focus structure in which both the head and non head daughter are overtly marked as focus, and they are interpreted as a pairwise list such that the focus background is applicable to this list, but not to other alternative lists.},

Our results support the growing body of evidence that the functions of encoding information source and epistemic modality are not necessarily distinct. The St’át’imcets data further provide a novel argument against the claim that evidentiality and epistemic modality are separate categories. Many authors argue that evidentials differ from modals in that the former do not encode speaker certainty (see, e.g., de Haan 1999; Aikhenvald 2004).We argue that modals are also not required to encode speaker certainty; we provide evidence from St’át’imcets that marking quantificational strength is not an intrinsic property of modal elements.},

  abstract = {The standard view of superlatives treats them as a subkind of adjectives. However, in many languages, superlatives require the presence of a determiner, even in the predicate position. This leads to an apparent contradiction, since it is independently known that determiners syntactically combine with extended NP projections and are excluded with APs. This issue is resolved if superlative adjectives always appear in an attributive (modificational) position. Superlative phrases without an overt noun (e.g., in the predicative position) modify a null head noun. I show that this hypothesis immediately explains the restrictions on the distribution of superlatives in languages as diverse as Russian, French, German, Dutch, Breton, Spanish and Portuguese. I propose that the modificational nature of superlative adjectives can be derived from their semantics, and I argue that such a proposal yields a natural explanation of the behavior of superlatives in Hebrew and Persian. Finally, I discuss the interaction between this theory and the standard, movement-based analyses of comparatives and superlatives and provide an explanation for apparent counterexamples.},

What these properties exactly are is often left unspecified. This paper explores the semantics of ad hoc kind-referring terms, where the determination of the relevant set of shared properties does not rely on "natural" properties or world knowledge. Rather, information provided by a nominal modifier, typically a relative clause, is used to impute the required regular behavior on the kind-referring NP. Building on Carlson (1977b)’s disjointness condition, I show that we can not only account for the ubiquity of these expressions, but we can also extend the analysis to other constructions that have traditionally not been taken to be kind-referring, such as Amount and Degree Relative constructions.},

  abstract = {When Ella Young Flagg, the first female superintendent of the Chicago Public Schools, proposed that educational leadership was a woman’s “natural field” she could not have predicted that one hundred years later women would have neither a majority of school leadership positions, nor would they be proportionally represented when compared with female teachers (Grogan \& Shakeshaft, 2011). Unlike the school leadership positions of the principal and superintendent that have been traditionally dominated by men, female leaders have achieved greater parity in special education administration (Keefe \& Parmley, 2003). Although female special education administrators represent an exception to this phenomenon of underrepresentation in school leadership, limited research has been done on this specific population. The purpose of this qualitative study with phenomenological interviewing was to understand the leadership experiences of female special education administrators. The central research question asked: How do female administrators in special education understand their leadership experiences? Eight female special education administrators shared how their personal history and their current leadership experiences influenced their leadership behaviors. For the female special education administrators, their leadership experiences were understood as (1) collaborative-relational, (2) instructional, (3) activism, (4) political, and (5) balanced. Parallels between women’s leadership and the foundations of special education offer an explanation for the success of women leaders in the field. A model of the ways female administrators of special education lead is included. The model demonstrates how collaborative-relational leadership is central to female leadership in special education. Recommendations for future research are included.},

A particularly challenging problem is the fact that in any one language, there seem to be lexemes that block progressive marking (such as the verbs ‘to know’ and ‘to understand’ in English). On the basis of comprehensive lexical samples from five languages, this study attempts to shed some light on the semantic factors governing the acceptability of progressive markers. This results in a modified outlook on the progressive.},

First, they have variable quantificational force, systematically allowing both possibility and necessity interpretations; and second, they lexically restrict the conversational background, distinguishing for example between deontic and (several kinds of) epistemic modality. We provide an analysis of the St’a´t’imcets modals according to which they are akin to specific indefinites in the nominal domain. They introduce choice function variables which select a subset of the accessible worlds. Following Klinedinst, we assume distributivity over the resulting set of worlds. St’a´t’imcets modals thus receive a uniform interpretation as (distributive) pluralities. The appearance of variability in modal force arises because the choice function can select a larger or smaller subset of accessible worlds. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis for the investigation of modal systems in other languages.},

  abstract = {According to certain versions of predicativism, names denote metalinguistic predicates of a certain type, e.g. the name Pero n as it occurs in the sentence Pero n died in 1974 denotes a predicate more or less paraphrasable as “being called Pero n” (Burge 1973, Matushansky 2008 and Fara 2011, among others). The metalinguistic theory of names is claimed to be superior in nontrivial ways to direct reference theories, according to which names contribute an individual without the mediation of descriptions (Kripke 1980). The alleged triumph of predicativism is that by assuming the “being called N” property as basic, both referential and non-referential uses of proper names can be given a uniform semantic analysis. By contrast, the referentialist needs to resort to homonymy or semantic ambiguity. In addition, there are some systematic connections between referential and predicative uses of names that at first glance also seem to favor predicativism. The goal of this paper is to present an alternative syntax, semantics and pragmatics of proper names. We assume that grammatical categories and the associated meanings that they are supposed to encode are not grammatical primitives, but epiphenomena that result from the particular way in which syntax combines functional material and lexical Roots. Before syntax, lexical Roots have no detectable meanings. On this account, there are no names before syntax, as there are no nouns, verbs or adjectives. Names are thus seen as the result of a particular syntactic configuration whose semantic realization is that of contributing an individual. Metalinguistic uses of names, and other derived uses, are involved in a different syntactic scheme, one that makes a name Root a predicate of a certain type. Besides their different syntactic basis, we argue that metalinguistic inferences in both referential and predicative uses of names have a pragmatic source. According to the theory we propose, then, the so-called Being Called Condition is neither a syntactic nor a semantic primitive. Under this conception of proper names the uniformity argument does not hold and the adduced linguistic evidence cannot lead to any (meta-)semantic consideration.},

  abstract = {In the first century b.c., Marcus Terentius Varro used the terms singularis and multitudinis in his grammar of Latin, De Lingua Latina, to refer to two classes of morphological marking (cf. Taylor 1996). Soon after Varro’s writing, the term pluralis replaced multitudinis (e.g. in Marcus Fabius Quintilian’s Institutio oratoria in the first century A.D.) while the term singularis caught on. Varro’s choice of terminology seems to have been inspired by a semantic intuition: Singularis literally means ‘alone’ and presumably was taken to mean that the cardinality of the intended referent of a noun is equal to one. Multitudinis, on the other hand, derives from multitudo (‘multitude/great number’).1 Pluralis, which replaced Varro’s term, derives from plus (‘more’). This choice of terminology suggests that multitudinis/pluralis forms entail that the cardinality of the intended referent is greater than one. Varro’s term singular and the term plural have come to be widely used in the linguistic literature as many languages display a similar distinction as Latin does. Moreover, Varro’s semantic intuition is widely accepted in current semantic work. For example, a fairly recent work on the semantics of plurality simply states: [Plurality] just means ‘more than one’ (Lasersohn 1995, ix). There are, however, several cases where the plural does not seem to imply cardinality greater than one. Consider the a. examples in (1) through (4), and compare them to the b. examples where two or more (or zwei (‘two’) in the German (4b)) is added to the plural noun.2 (1) a. You’re welcome to bring your children. b. You’re welcome to bring your two or more children. (2) a. Every boy should invite his sisters. b. Every boy should invite his two or more sisters. (3) a.

  abstract = {While it is now accepted that sign languages should inform and constrain theories of ‘Universal Grammar’, their role in ‘Universal Semantics’ has been under-studied. We argue that they have a crucial role to play in the foundations of semantics, for two reasons. First, in some cases sign languages provide overt evidence on crucial aspects of the Logical Form of sentences, ones that are only inferred indirectly in spoken language. For instance, sign language ‘loci’ are positions in signing space that can arguably realize logical variables, and the fact that they are overt makes it possible to revisit foundational debates about the syntactic reality of variables, about mechanisms of temporal and modal anaphora, and about the existence of dynamic binding. Another example pertains to mechanisms of ‘context shift’, which were postulated on the basis of indirect evidence in spoken language, but which are arguably overt in sign language. Second, along one dimension sign languages are strictly more expressive than spoken languages because iconic phenomena can be found at their logical core. This applies to loci themselves, which may simultaneously function as logical variables and as schematic pictures of what they denote (context shift comes with some iconic requirements as well). As a result, the semantic system of spoken languages can in some respects be seen as a simplified version of the richer semantics found in sign languages. Two conclusions could be drawn from this observation. One is that the full extent of Universal Semantics can only be studied in sign languages. An alternative possibility is that spoken languages have comparable expressive mechanisms, but only when co-speech gestures are taken into account (as recently argued by Goldin-Meadow and Brentari). Either way, sign languages have a crucial role to play in investigations of the foundations of semantics.},

This article is a survey of recent ideas about the interpretation of comparatives, including (i) the underlying semantics based on the idea of a threshold; (ii) the interpretation of comparative clauses that include quantifiers (                                brighter than on                 many                 other days                              ); (iii) remarks on differentials such as               much               in (1) above: what they do in the comparative and what they do elsewhere in the language; (iv) the relationship between comparatives and other Degree constructions (e.g.                                as                 important,                 too                 important                              ); and (v) the types of phrases in which comparatives are found (adjective:               tighter               versus noun:               more water               ). Given the nature and purpose of this essay, I have tried not to presuppose background in formal semantics and I have departed from standard practice in journal articles by, as much as possible, not interrupting the flow with footnotes and references. There are two appendices. The first provides more analytical detail and there I do rely on formal techniques of natural language semantics. The second covers the sources for the ideas surveyed here.},

Uniqueness or maximality inferences are expected to arise via covert type-shifting under these approaches. Our results are compatible with what we take to be the null hypothesis, namely that bare nominals in articleless languages are existential and free of presuppositional semantics, even if they correspond—in their use—to definite descriptions (Heim 2011).},

Based on a sample which includes data from Buryat, Komi, Mari, Mordvin, and Turkish, I propose that suffixal determiners form a semantically natural class in that their distribution can be modelled by means of a relational component in the semantics of the determiners which relates the denotation of the noun to an antecedent. I derive the observed distributional differences between languages from the range of values available for the interpretation of this component. In particular, whether a relation of identity falls within the range of values has consequences for whether a suffixal determiner triggers existence presupposition, which, in turn, has consequences both for the interpretation of the DP in question and for the inter-paradigm competition in a language.},

While Jackendoff (1972) proposed a one-to-one mapping between sentence-final contour and the scope of negation (falling contour: narrow scope, fall-rise contour: wide scope), in subsequent work, researchers (e.g. Ladd 1980; Ward \& Hirschberg 1985; Kadmon \& Roberts 1986) disentangled the link between prosody and scope. Even though these pragmatic accounts predict variability in production, they still allow for some correlation between scope and prosody. To date, we lack systematic evidence to bear on this discussion. Here, we present findings from two perception experiments aimed at investigating whether prosodic information~–~including, but not limited to, sentence-final contour~–~can successfully disambiguate such sentences. We show that when speakers provide consistent auditory cues to sentential interpretation, hearers can successfully recruit these cues to arrive at the correct interpretation as intended by the speaker. In light of these results, we argue that psycholinguistic studies (including language acquisition studies) investigating participants’ ability to access multiple interpretations of scopally ambiguous sentences~–~quantificational and otherwise~–~should carefully control for prosody.},

I extend this view to Hungarian, a language with contrastive focus movement, and show that a range of data, some of which pose a problem for a featuredriven approach, can be accounted for straightforwardly. Among these are the uniqueness of focus movement and the fact that verb-focusing does not strand the particle of particle-verbs (verb-movement generally strands it). The analysis extends to blocking effects between focusing and a phenomenon called particle climbing. It is concluded that the [+Focus]-feature is unnecessary to account for the data. Finally, it is shown that the alleged identificational focus vs. new information focus distinction of É.Kiss (1998b) is not supported by Hungarian data.},

This article establishes distinctions among projective contents on the basis of a series of diagnostics, including a variant of the family-of-sentences diagnostic, that can be applied with linguistically untrained consultants in the field and the laboratory. These diagnostics are intended to serve as part of a toolkit for exploring projective contents across languages, thus allowing generalizations to be examined and validated crosslinguistically. We apply the diagnostics in two languages, focusing on Paraguayan Guaraní (Tupí-Guaraní), and comparing the results to those for English. Our study of Paraguayan Guaraní is the first systematic exploration of projective content in a language other than English. Based on the application of our diagnostics to a wide range of constructions, four subclasses of projective contents emerge. The resulting taxonomy of projective content has strong implications for contemporary theories of projection (e.g. Karttunen 1974, Heim 1983, van der Sandt 1992, Potts 2005, Schlenker 2009), which were developed for the projective properties of particular subclasses and fail to generalize to the full set of projective contents.},

  abstract = {Some earlier treatments of the semantics of the prenominal genitive assume two syntactic types for genitive NPs like the girl's, one which combines with relational nouns like sister, and another that combines with non-relational nouns like car. In the former case the genitive relation is provided by the relational head noun, in the latter the source of the relation is taken to be provided by the utterance context. Our analysis uniformly assumes only one syntactic type for genitive NPs, viz., one that forces a genitive NP to combine only with relational nouns. In cases with inherently non-relational head nouns, such as the girl's car, we hypothesize that the genitive NP coerces a shift of the meaning of the head noun so that it becomes relational. To determine the sort of meaning shift which is carried out, we appeal to the qualia structure of the lexical entry for the head noun. A consequence of this analysis is an extension of the area of lexically determined interpretations and a corresponding reduction of the context-determined, pragmatic area.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a reconstruction of the Tractatus ontology. The basic idea is that objects are unsaturated and that Sachlagen are like molecules. Bisimulation is used for the proper individuation of the Sachlagen. We show that the ordering of the Sachlagen is a complete distributive, lattice. It is atomistic, i.e., each Sachlage is the supremum of the Sachverhalte below it. We exhibit three normal forms for Sachlagen: the bisimulation collapse, the canonical unraveling and the canonical bisimulation collapse. The first of these forms is unique modulo isomorphism, the second and third are simply unique. The subset ordering on normal forms of the second and third kind reflects the ordering of the Sachlagen.},

Does this a) ­reflect an intrinsic property of pronominals (Chomsky 1981), is it b) a relative (economy) effect, that only shows up where there is a more dedicated competitor (see from different perspectives, Safir 2004, Boeckx, Hornstein and Nunes 2007, Levinson 2000), does it c) have a semantic basis as in Schlenker (2005), or does it d) follow from general conditions on agree based chains, and reflexive predicates (Reuland 2011a)? To help resolve this issue, we investigate Khanty (Uralic, spoken in Northwest Siberia), a language that is reported to allow locally bound pronominals (Nikolaeva 1995), and assess whether it in fact does have them, and, which factors come into play when local binding obtains.},

  abstract = {The Fauconnier-Ladusaw analysis of negative polarity licensing (that NPIs are licensed in the scope of downward entailing operators) continues to be the benchmark theory of negative polarity. In this paper, I consider some of the moves that are needed to maintain its basic intuition in some recalcitrant arenas: negative polarity licensing by only, adversatives, superlatives, and conditionals. We will see that one has to (i) use a notion of entailment that I call Strawson Entailment, which deals with presuppositions in a particular way, and (ii) prohibit (even natural) context change during an inference. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to justify these constraints and to see in detail how the semantics of the problematic constructions has to work in order for these moves to successfully rescue the Fauconnier-Ladusaw analysis.},

Habituality in particular, as one of the less described TMA categories, has not yet been widely discussed for this group of languages. Based on corpus data and elicitations, we give a detailed overview of four languages, identifying common trends and addressing specific questions of general concern. These include the relation of habituality to (im)perfectivity and the relation between habituality and irrealis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This chapter critiques a number of standard ways of understanding the role of the metalanguage in a semantic theory for natural language, including the idea that disquotation plays a nontrivial role in any explanatory natural language semantics. It then proposes that the best way to understand the role of a semantic metalanguage involves recognizing that semantics is a model-based science. The metalanguage of semantics is language for articulating features of the theorist’s model. Models are understood as mediating instruments—idealized structures used to represent select aspects of the world, aspects the theorist is seeking some theoretical understanding of. The aspect of reality we are seeking some understanding of in semantics is a dimension of human linguistic competence—informally, knowledge of meaning.},

In particular, I will focus on the topmost part of the noun phrase, the one containing determiners and quantifiers, proposing that this part should be split into two maximal projections which together constitute the ‘determiner system.’ I propose that the highest maximal projection contains ‘strong’ determiners (in the sense of Milsark, 1974), proper names and personal pronouns, while the intermediate projection contains those determiners that can appear in predicative position (indefinites, plus the definite determiner in a well-specified set of cases); below this layer, we have other functional projections, and finally the NP proper.},

Its main tenets are, first, that all focusing is contrastive, i.e. points to a proper question —a question with contrasting answers; second, that any deviation from default stress signals focusing; there is no ‘anaphoric deaccenting’ of given elements, only contrastive focusing. Third, the question that licenses focusing need not be contextually salient, merely identifiable and relevant. Fourth and finally, where the prosodic realization of focusing requires prosodic demotion —the assignment of less-than-default stress to a constituent— that constituent must be given; a question under discussion, even if identifiable and relevant, cannot lead prosodic demotion of discourse-new elements.},
