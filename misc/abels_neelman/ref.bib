This behavior is derived by analyzing them as domain shrinking possible world quantifiers (see Kadman and Landman [Ling. and Philos. 16 (1993) 353] on negative polarity and domain expansion). It is argued that this analysis derives the major distributional properties of these adverbs. Particular attention is given to the adverb possibly.}

This universal cannot be formulated without reference to the kind of hierarchical structure generated by standard models of phrase structure. First, we document the empirical evidence: logically possible but crosslinguistically unattested combinations of head-final and head-initial orders. Second, we propose a theory, based on a version of Kayne’s (1994) Linear Correspondence Axiom, where FOFC is an effect of the distribution of a movement-triggering feature in extended projections, subject to Relativized Minimality.}",
